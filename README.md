# 🔐 ESP8266 RFID Access Control System with Telegram Notifications

This project is a smart door lock system built using an **ESP8266**, **RFID (RC522)**, **L298N motor driver**, and an **OLED display**. It allows authorized users to unlock a door using an RFID card, and sends **Telegram alerts** for access attempts (granted or denied). You can also **remotely unlock** the door via a web interface hosted on the ESP8266.
